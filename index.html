            You’d say, “Just one episode.” <br><br>
            I’d say, “Okay, last one.” <br><br>
            And five minutes later… I’d be asleep.

            I miss your voice reacting to scenes. <br>
            Your random commentary. <br>

            I just wanted you to know those nights were never ordinary to me. <br><br>
            They were my safe place. <br><br>
            Even if I slept early… <br>
            I was always exactly where I wanted to be.
