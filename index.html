            Not in a place.<br>
            In a show.<br>
            In a couch.<br>
            In each other.

            You’d say, “Just one episode.”<br><br>
            I’d say, “Okay, last one.”<br><br>
            And five minutes later… I’d be asleep.

            But I never slept through the part that mattered.<br><br>
            You.

            I don’t miss the show.<br><br>
            I miss your voice reacting to scenes.<br>
            Your laugh in between dialogues.<br>
            The way comfort felt effortless.

        <p>
            I’m not asking for anything.<br><br>
            I just wanted you to know<br>
            those nights were never ordinary to me.<br><br>
            They were my safe place.<br><br>
            Even if I slept early…<br>
            I was exactly where I wanted to be.
